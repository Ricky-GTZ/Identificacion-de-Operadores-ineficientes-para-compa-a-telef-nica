# Identification of Inefficient Operators for a Telecom Company
## Brief Description:
This project aimed to identify operators who did not meet certain performance criteria for a telecom company.
To identify inefficient operators, average parameters were defined among them, such as:
The average number of calls per operator
The average waiting times for each operator
The average number of outgoing calls per operator
Based on these parameters, each operator was analyzed to verify whether their metrics were below average.
## üõ†Ô∏èTechnologies Used: 
* Python: Pandas
*  Tableau.
*  Jupyter Notebooks
## Key Responsibilities:
Compared each operator‚Äôs metrics with the average parameters per operator to identify underperforming and inefficient operators.
## Impact / Achievements:
Identified 13% of operators as underperforming and 0.27% as inefficient.
